            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject I learned were

            looking to make a transmission and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experiance here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enroled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since
            completing the course I've successfully switched carriers, working
            as a Software Engineer as a VR startup."

            " Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hand-on and I nevr had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial can ever have.
            In fact, I've often referred it during interviews as an example of
            my development experiance. It clearly helped me to land a job as a
            full stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100%
            recommended! "
